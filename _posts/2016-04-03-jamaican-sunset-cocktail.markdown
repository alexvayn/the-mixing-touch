As we approach the summer months and the warm weather sets in, why not get a head start and kick things off with a delicious, tropical cocktail?

Join me and my buddy Rich, as we mix up this Jamaican Sunset, inspired by The Modern Mixologist book.

## Jamaican Sunset Cocktail Recipe

* 1 1/2 oz Sailor Jerry's Spiced Rum
* 1 1/2 oz Fresh-squeezed Orange Juice
* 1 1/2 oz Pineapple Juice
* 1 oz Fresh Lemon Sour Mix (1 part lemon juice, 1 part simple syrup)
* 1/4 oz Pomegranate Syrup
* 1/2 oz Myers's Dark Rum

Combine the first 4 ingredients with ice in a mixing glass and shake. Strain into an ice-filled Collins glass. Pour the pomegranate syrup down the side and let it float to the bottom. Top off with the Myer's rum.
