This cocktail is so delicious and feels so luxurious, you wouldn't even notice that it doesn't have any alcohol in it. Mildly fruity and extremely refreshing. Perfect for a winter day.

* 1/2 oz pomegranate syrup
* 1/4 oz mango vinegar with pulp
* 2 dashes rhubarb bitters
* sparkling water (enough to top off)

Combine all the ingredients in a rocks glass with a giant ice cube. Stir gently but thorougly with a spoon. Garnish with a strawberry.
