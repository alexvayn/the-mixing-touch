This one's got a bite, so watch out! A perfect mocktail as we wrap up spring and head into the summer.

Grapefruit Jalapeno Mojito Recipe:

* 2 oz fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice
* 1 oz simple syrup
* 1/4 jalapeno, chopped coarsely
* Sparkling water, to top off
* Sprig or two of fresh mint

Muddle the jalapeno pieces with the simple syrup. Add the grapefruit juice. Shake with ice and double-strain into a tall ice-filled glass. Top off with sparkling water and garnish with mint.
